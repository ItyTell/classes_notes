	abstract = {In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS, H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On one side, scientists have developed vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose models that can help in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared, especially for pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical area, often worldwide. Also, the population distribution and social coherence in the different regions of the world are non-uniform. Thus, once the epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an important role. Inspired by these ideas, we propose two versions of our mobility-based SIR model, (i) fully mixed and (ii) for complex networks, which especially takes into account real-life interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first of its kind, which takes into account the population distribution, connectivity of different geographic locations across the globe, and individuals’ network connectivity information. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of our models, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data to demonstrate the generalization capability of our models. Finally, to demonstrate the wider scope of our model, we applied our model to forecast the COVID-19 cases at county level (Estonia) and regional level (Rhône-Alpes region in France).},

	abstract = {Compartmental models are a very general modelling technique. They are often applied to the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. The population is assigned to compartments with labels – for example, S, I,  or R, (Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered). People may progress between compartments. The order of the labels usually shows the flow patterns between the compartments; for example SEIS means susceptible, exposed, infectious, then susceptible again.
The origin of such models is the early 20th century, with important works being that of Ross in 1916, Ross and Hudson in 1917, Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 and Kendall in 1956. The Reed-Frost model was also a significant and widely-overlooked ancestor of modern epidemiological modelling approaches.The models are most often run with ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be used with a stochastic (random) framework, which is more realistic but much more complicated to analyze.
Models try to predict things such as how a disease spreads, or the total number infected, or the duration of an epidemic, and to estimate various epidemiological parameters such as the reproductive number. Such models can show how different public health interventions may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.},

Using this SEIR model, and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates and mask use per capita), we assessed scenarios of social distancing mandates and levels of mask use. Projections of current non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies by state—with social distancing mandates reinstated when a threshold of 8 deaths per million population is exceeded (reference scenario)—suggest that, cumulatively, 511,373 (469,578–578,347) lives could be lost to COVID-19 across the United States by 28 February 2021. We find that achieving universal mask use (95\% mask use in public) could be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Universal mask use could save an additional 129,574 (85,284–170,867) lives from September 22, 2020 through the end of February 2021, or an additional 95,814 (60,731–133,077) lives assuming a lesser adoption of mask wearing (85\%), when compared to the reference scenario.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was one of the major events in South Korea in 2015. In particular, this study pays attention to formulating a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates.
Methods
Incidence data of MERS-CoV from the government authority was analyzed for the first aim and a mathematical model was built and analyzed for the second aim of the study. A mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics is used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions.
Results
Using the estimates of the transmission rates, the basic reproduction number was estimated in two periods. Due to the superspreader, the basic reproduction number was very large in the first period; however, the basic reproduction number of the second period has reduced significantly after intensive interventions.
Conclusion
It turned out to be the intensive isolation and quarantine interventions that were the most critical factors that prevented the spread of the MERS outbreak. The results are expected to be useful to devise more efficient intervention strategies in the future.},

The basic reproduction number R0 which is the threshold dynamics parameter between the disappearance and the persistence of the disease has been calculated. And, it is obvious to see that it varies directly to the number of hospitalized people, asymptomatic, symptomatic carriers and the impact of media coverage. The local and the global stabilities of the model have also been investigated by using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion and the Lyapunov’s functional technique, respectively. Furthermore, we have performed a local sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of any variation in each one of the model parameter on the threshold R0 and the course of the disease accordingly. We have also computed the approximative rate at which herd immunity will occur when any control measure is implemented. To finish, we have presented some numerical simulation results by using some available data from the literature to corroborate our theoretical findings.},

	abstract = {Numerical analysis presents different faces to the world. For mathematicians it is a bona fide mathematical theory with an applicable flavour. For scientists and engineers it is a practical, applied subject, part of the standard repertoire of modelling techniques. For computer scientists it is a theory on the interplay of computer architecture and algorithms for real-number calculations. The tension between these standpoints is the driving force of this book, which presents a rigorous account of the fundamentals of numerical analysis of both ordinary and partial differential equations. The point of departure is mathematical but the exposition strives to maintain a balance between theoretical, algorithmic and applied aspects of the subject. In detail, topics covered include numerical solution of ordinary differential equations by multistep and Runge-Kutta methods; finite difference and finite elements techniques for the Poisson equation; a variety of algorithms to solve large, sparse algebraic systems; methods for parabolic and hyperbolic differential equations and techniques of their analysis. The book is accompanied by an appendix that presents brief back-up in a number of mathematical topics. Dr Iserles concentrates on fundamentals: deriving methods from first principles, analysing them with a variety of mathematical techniques and occasionally discussing questions of implementation and applications. By doing so, he is able to lead the reader to theoretical understanding of the subject without neglecting its practical aspects. The outcome is a textbook that is mathematically honest and rigorous and provides its target audience with a wide range of skills in both ordinary and partial differential equations.},
